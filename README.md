# nextflow-hpc-workshop

This workshop is designed for researchers and technical users (bioinformaticians, life scientists, and data scientists) who:
  -  Have access to HPC systems (e.g., institutional, national, or cloud-based clusters)
  -  Have run simple Nextflow pipelines, typically in a one-sample-per-run or manual scripting context
  -  Are now looking to scale up their workflows, optimise performance, and apply best practices for HPC environments
 
## Pre-requisites 
-  Completed the “Hello Nextflow” Workshop, or have equivalent experience (e.g. basic understanding of how to create and run a Nextflow pipeline)
-  Basic command like skills, including:
    -  Navigating directories and manipulating files
    -  Working knowledge of how to run bash scripts and interpret terminal output
-  Familiarity with concepts like multi-sample processing and reproducible analysis (e.g. containers)
-  Familiarity with how HPC clusters work (e.g., job submission, compute nodes)
